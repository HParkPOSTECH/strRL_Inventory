### Code for paper "Adaptive Inventory Replenishment using Structured Reinforcement Learning by Exploiting a Policy Structure"

- The code needs four input as below:
  - N: # of items
      - the current version of code allow item size lower than <= 4
      - over the item 4, algorithm is defined as relaxed version (see appendix S), which just checks computational times in the paper
  - T: type of algorithm
      - SRL-FSA: Structured RL with full stochastic approximation (see section 4.2)
      - SRL-FSA: Structured RL with partial stochastic approximation (see section 4.3)
  - D: demonstrative demand distribution
    - gamma: gamma demand distribution Gamma(2, 1)
    - normal: truncated normal demand distribution N(3, 1; d >= 0)
    - poisson: poisson demand distribution Poisson(2)
  - S: stationarity of demand
    - stationary: stationary demand system
    - non-stationary: non-stationary demand switching scenario 

- We establish input formats corresponding to the numerical studies in our paper (in directory "./input")
